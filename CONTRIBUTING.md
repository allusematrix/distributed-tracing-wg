# Governance and Contribution to the Distributed Tracing working group

This document describes the contribution and governance rules for the [W3C Distributed Tracing Working Group](https://www.w3.org/2018/distributed-tracing/). This includes the following specifications:

- [Trace Context](https://github.com/w3c/trace-context)
- [Baggage](https://github.com/w3c/baggage)

## Interacting with the working group

The working group encourages all forms of contribution and questions. If you have a question, please open an issue on Github in the specification repository. 

## Collaboration under the W3C Process Model

As the working group is an W3C working group it operates under the [W3C Process Model](https://www.w3.org/2018/Process-20180201/). All further contribution guidelines only extend the W3C process model. If this document and the process model contradict each other, the W3C process model takes precedence.


## Meetings

Meetings follow the [W3C Process Model Guidelines for Meetings](https://www.w3.org/2018/Process-20180201/#GeneralMeetings). This section defines additional meeting guidelines extending these guidelines:

- Official conference calls are held on a bi-weekly basis and are announced on a [shared calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=dynatrace.com_5a09qhua6fh7jb23h7vdjg6veg%40group.calendar.google.com)
- Face-to-face topic-based work meetings will be announced at least 4 weeks in advance. Ideally, they are announce 8 weeks in advance as defined in the W3C process model. 
- Proposed changes to any document MUST be handled via a Pull Request (PR). If the change came up during a meeting the meeting owner is responsible for creating the PR.
- PRs will be reviewed during official meetings, but off-line reviews (LGTMs, NOT LGTMs) and comments are strongly encouraged to gauge the group's opinion on the proposed change prior to the meeting.
- If a topic is not defined specifically enough yet to justify a PR against the specification, contributors are encouraged to file an issue. 
- During meetings, priority will be given to PRs that appear to be ready for a vote over those that appear to require discussions.
- Rebases, typo fixes, etc. do not count as substantial. Note, administrative PRs that do not materially modify output documents may be processed by admins as needed.
- PR's can be marked for resolution during a meeting and will be merged when all issues have been addressed and the PR was open for comments for at least one business week. 
- If issues arise after a PR has been merged, the preferred approach is to file a new issue. In rare cases the group can decide to revert a PR.

## Participation  

There are three categories of project participation:

1. Non Working Group Member. This is anyone who  participates in the group's activities in any of our communication channels (email, github issues/PRs, meetings, etc.). In contrast to Working Group members they can file a PR but not vote on a PR. They can, however, create issues for specifications. 
2. Working Group Member. This is anyone who officially participates in the group's activities in any of our communication channels (email, github issues/PRs, meetings, etc.). Working group members can file PRs against documents and can participate in the PR voting procedure. Working Group members need to be employed by a W3C member organization or participate as invited experts. The [W3C process document](https://www.w3.org/2018/Process-20180201/#MemberBenefits) defines the rights of members. 
3. Chairs and Co-Chairs are members of the group but have the ability to perform administrative actions on behalf of the group. For example, manage the website, github repos and moderate the meetings. Their actions should be done with the knowledge and consent of the group. They also have the ability to merge/close PRs, but only per the group's approval. 

## PRs and Voting

Specificaiton changes are proposed via PRs which are expected to meet the following criteria prior to being merged:

- The author of the PR indicates that it is ready setting a "ready to review" tag for review by asking for it to be discussed in an upcoming meeting - eg. by adding it to the agenda document.
- All comments have been addressed.
- PRs that have objections/concerns will be discussed in dedicated by interested parties. A resolution, updated PR, will be expected from those talks.
- PRs conform to all styles in [STYLE.md](STYLE.md).
  Exceptions should be approved by working group members on the pull request review.
  Exceptions which are not obvious should be documented by a comment.

Every member of the working group is encouraged to vote with a statement of support and dissent on any PR. If a member has concerns regarding a PR they are encouraged to comment on the issue and join in discussions. If a member does reply to a comment within a reasonable timeframe - one business week - the comment is considered properly addressed. 

The goal of the working group is to reach consensus by discussion. If consensus cannot be reached the [W3C Voting rules](https://www.w3.org/2018/Process-20180201/#Votes) apply.
